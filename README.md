# Supervised-Predictive-Modeling-Of-Space-Weather-Events-Using-Remote-Sensing-Observations
Deep Learning models to predict Ozone density and NO Infrared Radiative Flux. Model is trained using the data obtained by SABER instrument on NASA's Timed Satellite and data from WDC Kyoto's website. 
AutoEncoders are used to learn the optimized representation of data. This data is then feed to an Artificial Neural Network which is being trained to predict Ozone density and NO IRF. 
This repository also contains the codes which were used to: obtain data from SABER Website, Conversion of data from netCDF4 format to CSV format, Preprocessing of data, Adding WDC data to the main dataset.
This also have the final datasets which were used to train the models.
